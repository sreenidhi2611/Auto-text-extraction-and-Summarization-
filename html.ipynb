            "<h5>Background:  Most researchers in Uzbekistan prefer to publish their reports in journals of their home country.| Moreover, the proportion of healthcare practitioners who prefer to use these national sources of information also| remains high. However, the quality of publications from national journals, in post-Soviet countries, has not been| systematically evaluated until now. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of randomized| controlled trials ’  (RCTs) reports published in medical journals from Uzbekistan. We supposed that reports had at| least minimal quality to contribute to the higher quality of healthcare.|\n",
            "<h5>Methods:  To evaluate the quality of RCTs, we selected two journals from the list of national medical journals for| which background information was provided. We decided to select articles from journals that had the highest| subscription rate and were likely to have the highest impact on clinical decisions. The journals were  Medical Journal| of Uzbekistan  and  Paediatrics . Only issues published in 2007 – 2017 were considered for evaluation. Two evaluators| independently scored RCTs and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) reported in the journals. The 5-point scale developed| by Jadad et al. was used to evaluate the quality of reports. Consensus-based decision was made about the final| score of each report.| Results:  We reviewed 1311 studies in the two journals and found 380 clinical trials reports for the final evaluation.| Our main finding was that none of the reports received a final score of more than 1, with an absolute agreement| between evaluators. A median score of the studied reports was equal to 0, predicting a very low quality of| controlled trials reported in the national journals (Wilcoxon signed-rank test  p  = 1.0; 95% CI = 0 – 0).|\n",
            "<h5>Conclusions:  We believe that quality of reports about controlled trials, in Uzbekistan, can be considered insufficient| to contribute to the higher quality of care and patients ’  safety. In the worst case, such condition can cause serious| damage to the public health and lead to ineffective use of resources in the country. Therefore, the better reporting| and organization of RCTs and CCTs should become a main goal of all stakeholders interested in the effective and| safe healthcare in the country.|\n",

            "<p>In post-Soviet countries, language barriers and poor| access to international databases in medical schools and| facilities have isolated students and practitioners from| high-quality evidence. These factors made a contribution| to the low quality of healthcare, in those countries [ 1 ,  2 ].| Moreover, such isolation contributed to outdated study| designs, with low incentives for researchers to organize| scientifically rigorous studies. The limited availability of| foreign medical literature slowed down integration into| the international scientific community, hindering the| advancement in medical researches [ 3 ]. A weak attention| to the evidence in the framework of under- and post-| graduate medical education became an additional impedi-| ment to higher quality of studies [ 4 ,  5 ]. As a result, a poor| design of studies, combined with an improper statistical| analysis, restricted an inclusion of Russian medical publi-| cations in meta-analyses round the world [ 6 ].| A concept, supported by WHO, emphasizes the growing| importance of well-designed primary studies from middle-| and low-income countries in improving guidance of health| systems [ 7 ]. The role of high-quality randomized controlled| trials (RCTs) becomes crucial in addressing this concept.| Until now, reviews of the quality of reports in post-Soviet| countries covered only studies from Russia or close neigh-| bouring countries. In the last period of time, the popularity| of international databases such as PubMed increased in all| post-Soviet countries, including Uzbekistan [ 2 ]. Researchers| and medical professionals, in those countries, presumably| became less isolated from global science than they were| previously. However, the portion of researchers who pub-| lish their reports in national journals, which are not indexed| in international databases, remains still high [ 8 ]. Moreover,| the proportion of healthcare practitioners who prefer to use| national sources of information also remains high [ 9 ]. Des-| pite those facts, the quality of publications from national| journals has hardly ever been systematically evaluated. It is| known that most journals in the world accept CONSORT| checklist as a submission guideline for reported RCTs [ 10 ].| However, it is not clear whether such checklists are used in| the national journals and how their use impacts on the| quality of the reports. As a method for evaluation,| Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) is a widely preferred tool, this| time [ 11 ].| The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the| quality of RCTs ’  reports published in medical journals from| Uzbekistan. An original hypothesis supposed that reports| had at least minimal quality to contribute to the higher qual-| ity of healthcare. We decided to evaluate reports published| in national journals during at least one-decade period.|\n",

            "<h4>Methods|\n",
            "<p>For our study, we selected journals from a list published| on Uzbek Ministry of Health (MoH) ‘ s webpage [ 12 ].|\n",
            "<p>After the exclusion of newspapers and magazines, nine| journals from that list were considered for the study.| Due to the budgetary concerns, we were not able to| evaluate reports from all nine journals. Because it was| technically impossible to identify all RCTs ’  reports| published in the journals and randomly select from| them, we applied a non-random approach. We decided| to select articles from journals that had the highest| subscription rate and were likely to have the highest| impact on clinical decisions made by national practi-| tioners. So, we picked two journals from nine, for which| information about their aims and scopes were provided| and which had the highest subscription rates. The first| journal was  Medical Journal of Uzbekistan , founded in| 1922; the second was  Paediatrics , founded in 1996. Both| journals were registered by the ISSN International| Centre and had unique codes. They published reports in| different areas of medicine, while the rest of journals| covered only specific subjects such as immunology,| dermatology, cardiology, neurology and surgery. Either| selected journal published articles only in Russian or| Uzbek, with providing abstracts in English.|\n",
            "\n",
            "<s1>Inclusion criteria|\n",
            "<p>We analyzed reports published in the two journals during| an 11 year period (2007 – 2017). For criteria to include| studies, we referred to Cochrane definitions of RCTs and| controlled clinical trials (CCTs) [ 13 ]. We evaluated all re-| ports of RCTs and CCTs, in which individuals were  “ def-| initely or possibly assigned prospectively to one of two (or| more) alternative forms of health care ” . An explicit use of| some variant of the term  “ random ”  in the report classified| the trial into RCTs. The rest of the trials were considered| CCTs, and because randomization could not be ruled out| in them, they were also included to the analysis.| We conducted handsearching in both electronic and| paper issues of journals to find all reports of RCTs and| CCTs. The search strategy suggested screening the titles| and abstracts to spot information related to inclusion| criteria. This strategy helped to find studies in which| “ randomized controlled trial ”  or  “ controlled clinical trial ”| was not mentioned in their titles. Full reports were obtained| only for studies where there was insufficient information in| the title and abstract. One researcher (IGG) selected re-| ports, and only those approved by other two evaluators| were selected for the final evaluation with the use of the| assessment tool. Reports written in either Russian or Uzbek| were included in the study. We extracted an information| about the sample size, types of interventions, outcomes| measured and authors involved for all included trials.|\n",

The Jadad scale is still used widely for system-| atic assessments of RCTs, and it does not require the| intense training of reviewers, a condition required to| provide for high reliability of the RoB method [ 17 – 21 ].| As procedure requires, first, we evaluated each report| according to the following three primary questions to| detect the sources of the possible bias in RCTs and CCTs:|\n",
            "<p>1. Was the study described as randomized (this| concept includes the use of words such as| randomly, random, and randomization)?| 2. Was the study described as double blind?| 3. Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts?|\n",

Only whole numbers and no in-| between marks were acceptable for the analysis. Each art-| icle was assessed and scored independently by two evalua-| tors (TYA and DJA), who also later arrived at a consensus| score. In the second step, we evaluated the appropriate-| ness of the randomization and double blinding procedures| by additional criteria. By those criteria, scores awarded for| the first two questions could be upscored (+ 1 or + 2| points) or downscored ( − 1 or  − 2 points). The final score| that each report received could range from 0 to 5, with a| score of 3 or more indicating superior quality [ 14 ]. Con-| sensus meetings were conducted in case of a disagreement| between evaluators. The third author (IGG) served as the| arbiter in the deciding on a consensus score.|\n",

            "<p>We reviewed 1311 studies in the two journals to find| reports of RCTs and CCTs. The number and proportion|\n",
            "<p>of clinical trials varied greatly in issues of the journals.| Neither journal had specific requirements for reporting| results of RCTs or CCTs and for registration of the| trials. One journal required authors to follow the Inter-| national Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)| uniform requirements for the publishing reports in| medical journals. Because reports of trials could be| potentially published in various sections of the journals,| we reviewed all sections per issue. We noted that none| of| the| selected| trials| had| mentioned| “ randomized| controlled trial ”  or  “ controlled clinical trial ”  in their title.| A review and a study selection process are outlined in| Fig.  1 .| We included 380 clinical trials ’  reports for the final| evaluation. The sample size in the included trials ranged| from 9 to 2563, and 117 studies had 100 or more partici-| pants. The number of groups, their characteristics and| the types of interventions in the trials, also varied in the| both| journals.| Only| trials| reported| in| Paediatrics| engaged < 18 years-old participants as a specific group of| all cases. In 32% of reports, published in both journals,| clinically important outcomes were replaced by unim-| portant (surrogate) biochemical or other endpoints,| supposedly attributed to some diseases or conditions. In| 71% of all reports, the trials involved no more than three| authors. Statisticians were declared to be involved in| 2.9% of all studies, and in none of studies they were| involved as coauthors. The categorical description of the| included trials is provided in Table  2 .| Most included reports had such special sections as| Introduction, Methods and Conclusions, in their struc-| ture. We also noticed that none of reports contained| special sections to discuss results of the trials and their| limitations. Another notable issue was that authors of| controlled trials emphasized positive effects of interven-| tions in their study, with minimal discussion of negative| outcomes. None of reports contained special notes about| the risk of conflict of interest, in authors.|\n",

            "<p>The results of this study showed a very poor quality of| RCTs and CCTs published in the two national journals| of Uzbekistan, from 2007 to 2017. Specifically, these| findings were related to the reporting of such key com-| ponents of clinical trials as the random assignment of| participants and the double blinding of the interventions.| The proportion of the reports, in which specific descrip-| tions were provided, was critically small in both journals.| However, those reports were not given a minimal final|\n",
            "<p>score because the randomization and double blinding| were not reported appropriately.| The quality of reports that we found on our study| differs from the global trend that shows an overall| increase in the quality of reported trials. Two reviews,| evaluating the quality of RCTs, concluded that the poor| reporting and the use of inadequate methods had| decreased over the last decade, especially regarding| sequence generation and allocation concealment [ 25 ,| 26 ]. However, in both reviews, the Cochrane RoB tool| was used to evaluate quality of the trials. A recent study| showed that authors using the RoB tool often make| scoring mistakes [ 27 ]. In those reviews, a higher journal| impact factor was associated with a lower proportion of| trials rated as unclear or having a high risk of bias. In| this respect, we found that neither of two journals| tracked the progress with citations of its articles in any| way. We suggest that both journals have a high rate of| national citations because of their popularity among| researchers. However, as we found, such popularity did| not reduce the risk of bias in the trials reported on| them.| Our findings raise concern that many clinicians in| Uzbekistan still apply low-quality clinical evidences in| their practice. This problem can be critical for practi-| tioners who have poor English-language proficiency or| find the Internet confusing. The number of such practi-| tioners remains high in Uzbekistan [ 9 ]. Lack of skills in| the critical assessment of the information aggravates the| problem. In this situation, practitioners have no alterna-| tive but to use poor evidences from available national| journals. Therefore, it is important to improve all| language courses, including those in an undergraduate| curriculum. Existing courses of English should include| skills in the reading of articles from medical journals,| the basics of language proficiency in medicine. Regular| trainings of clinicians in how to use international data-| bases and to evaluate quality of reports could have an| important additional benefit. A study demonstrated that| such educational approach would contribute to the use| of better evidences in the practice [ 28 ].| In addition to the lack of the good evidence for practi-| tioners, the poor quality of trials raises ethical issues|\n",

A collection of informed consent, in such| trials, cannot address its primary mission which is to get| feedback from human subjects who can consider all pos-| sible risks. It is unrealistic to expect that consent forms| informed patients that they would, possibly, take part in| the low-quality trial. A personal risk of participating in| the poorly designed trial can be high, and such risk| hardly can be predicted and accepted by the researcher.| From a justice view, a non-random or unclear approach,| reported in the national trials, can contribute to unfair| allocation of their participants. In this way, researchers| can allocate subjects of the study, basing on such| unacceptable criteria as income or education level of the| subjects or their ability to stand up for their own rights.| If we consider that about a third of the trials evaluated| in our study engaged more than 100 participants, the| amount of resources spent inefficiently becomes import-| ant. In this regard, the formal registration of trials and| their ethical assessment, at least at the national level,| could play a positive role in reducing publication bias| [ 29 – 31 ]. However, neither journal on our study required| registration of trials either at the time of a submission or| a peer review of reports. The formal instructions for| organization of clinical trials in Uzbekistan are provided| in a MoH decree, and such issues as the randomization| and blinding are highlighted in that decree. A notable| finding of our analysis was that none of the evaluated| studies were indicated as a  “ randomized controlled trial ”| or  “ controlled clinical trial ”  in their title.| It becomes clear that journals, we examined, prefer to| accept for publication all that is submitted by authors. In| practice, every journal should instead require from| authors  –  even if they submit controlled trials not indi-| cated as RCTs  –  to follow specific rules for the reporting| RCTs. Neither of the journals in our study required| authors| to| follow| such| rules.| Both| journals| were| concerned only| with the structure of articles and| provided guidelines for the text formation. One of the| journals instructed authors to follow the ICMJE uniform| requirements. But the  “ preparing for submission ”  section| of those requirements clearly provides CONSORT as the| reporting guideline for randomized trials [ 32 ]. However,| there was no mention or link to that guideline on the| website of the journal. By requiring the use of reporting| guidelines and checklists by authors, editors and peer-| reviewers can improve reporting of RCT methodology.| This way the journals can reduce omission of crucial in-| formation, selective reporting, and presentation of data| in a confusing and misleading way [ 33 – 35 ].| It is possible that some of the examined trials were| organized well, but authors did not report the method-| ology properly. However, severely low scores we gave for| all included trials suggests substantial problems with the|\n",

The lack of qualified specialists in biostatistics,| who could contribute to a better organization of studies,| is an additional factor lowering quality of the controlled| trials.

In our| study, the cases of disagreement were found in the process| of rating by three basic criteria. In that stage, the  κ -index| indicated moderate or substantial agreement between the| evaluators. The role of consensus-based approach, used in| the study, was important for this issue. The issue of blind-| ing could also confound the results, in that both evalua-| tors initially knew all characteristics of journals and| published trials. However, an assessment of reliability did| not prove the significant role of blinding on the Jadad ’ s| quality score [ 14 ]. More detailed tools for evaluation, such| as the Cochrane RoB or PEDro scales, are more compre-| hensive and their use could add benefits to the study. Our| study is also limited in that it used non-random approach| and included only reports published in a subset of national| journals, and only those reported from 2007 to 2017.| However, a historically similar organization of controlled| trials by researchers as well as the same editorial policy of| journals, in post-Soviet countries [ 1 ,  2 ], could suggest that| our results can be applied not only to the most recently| published trials but also to some other national journals.|\n",

            "<h5>Background:  Most researchers in Uzbekistan prefer to publish their reports in journals of their home country.| Moreover, the proportion of healthcare practitioners who prefer to use these national sources of information also| remains high. However, the quality of publications from national journals, in post-Soviet countries, has not been| systematically evaluated until now. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of randomized| controlled trials ’  (RCTs) reports published in medical journals from Uzbekistan. We supposed that reports had at| least minimal quality to contribute to the higher quality of healthcare.|\n",
            "<h5>Methods:  To evaluate the quality of RCTs, we selected two journals from the list of national medical journals for| which background information was provided. We decided to select articles from journals that had the highest| subscription rate and were likely to have the highest impact on clinical decisions. The journals were  Medical Journal| of Uzbekistan  and  Paediatrics . Only issues published in 2007 – 2017 were considered for evaluation. Two evaluators| independently scored RCTs and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) reported in the journals. The 5-point scale developed| by Jadad et al. was used to evaluate the quality of reports. Consensus-based decision was made about the final| score of each report.| Results:  We reviewed 1311 studies in the two journals and found 380 clinical trials reports for the final evaluation.| Our main finding was that none of the reports received a final score of more than 1, with an absolute agreement| between evaluators. A median score of the studied reports was equal to 0, predicting a very low quality of| controlled trials reported in the national journals (Wilcoxon signed-rank test  p  = 1.0; 95% CI = 0 – 0).|\n",
            "<h5>Conclusions:  We believe that quality of reports about controlled trials, in Uzbekistan, can be considered insufficient| to contribute to the higher quality of care and patients ’  safety. In the worst case, such condition can cause serious| damage to the public health and lead to ineffective use of resources in the country. Therefore, the better reporting| and organization of RCTs and CCTs should become a main goal of all stakeholders interested in the effective and| safe healthcare in the country.|\n",

            "<h4>Abstract|\n",
            "<h5>Background:  Most researchers in Uzbekistan prefer to publish their reports in journals of their home country.| Moreover, the proportion of healthcare practitioners who prefer to use these national sources of information also| remains high. However, the quality of publications from national journals, in post-Soviet countries, has not been| systematically evaluated until now. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of randomized| controlled trials ’  (RCTs) reports published in medical journals from Uzbekistan. We supposed that reports had at| least minimal quality to contribute to the higher quality of healthcare.|\n",
            "<h5>Methods:  To evaluate the quality of RCTs, we selected two journals from the list of national medical journals for| which background information was provided. We decided to select articles from journals that had the highest| subscription rate and were likely to have the highest impact on clinical decisions. The journals were  Medical Journal| of Uzbekistan  and  Paediatrics . Only issues published in 2007 – 2017 were considered for evaluation. Two evaluators| independently scored RCTs and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) reported in the journals. The 5-point scale developed| by Jadad et al. was used to evaluate the quality of reports. Consensus-based decision was made about the final| score of each report.| Results:  We reviewed 1311 studies in the two journals and found 380 clinical trials reports for the final evaluation.| Our main finding was that none of the reports received a final score of more than 1, with an absolute agreement| between evaluators. A median score of the studied reports was equal to 0, predicting a very low quality of| controlled trials reported in the national journals (Wilcoxon signed-rank test  p  = 1.0; 95% CI = 0 – 0).|\n",
            "<h5>Conclusions:  We believe that quality of reports about controlled trials, in Uzbekistan, can be considered insufficient| to contribute to the higher quality of care and patients ’  safety. In the worst case, such condition can cause serious| damage to the public health and lead to ineffective use of resources in the country. Therefore, the better reporting| and organization of RCTs and CCTs should become a main goal of all stakeholders interested in the effective and| safe healthcare in the country.|\n",

            "<h4>Abstract|\n",
            "<h5>Background:  Most researchers in Uzbekistan prefer to publish their reports in journals of their home country.| Moreover, the proportion of healthcare practitioners who prefer to use these national sources of information also| remains high. However, the quality of publications from national journals, in post-Soviet countries, has not been| systematically evaluated until now. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of randomized| controlled trials ’  (RCTs) reports published in medical journals from Uzbekistan. We supposed that reports had at| least minimal quality to contribute to the higher quality of healthcare.|\n",
            "<h5>Methods:  To evaluate the quality of RCTs, we selected two journals from the list of national medical journals for| which background information was provided. We decided to select articles from journals that had the highest| subscription rate and were likely to have the highest impact on clinical decisions. The journals were  Medical Journal| of Uzbekistan  and  Paediatrics . Only issues published in 2007 – 2017 were considered for evaluation. Two evaluators| independently scored RCTs and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) reported in the journals. The 5-point scale developed| by Jadad et al. was used to evaluate the quality of reports. Consensus-based decision was made about the final| score of each report.| Results:  We reviewed 1311 studies in the two journals and found 380 clinical trials reports for the final evaluation.| Our main finding was that none of the reports received a final score of more than 1, with an absolute agreement| between evaluators. A median score of the studied reports was equal to 0, predicting a very low quality of| controlled trials reported in the national journals (Wilcoxon signed-rank test  p  = 1.0; 95% CI = 0 – 0).|\n",
            "<h5>Conclusions:  We believe that quality of reports about controlled trials, in Uzbekistan, can be considered insufficient| to contribute to the higher quality of care and patients ’  safety. In the worst case, such condition can cause serious| damage to the public health and lead to ineffective use of resources in the country. Therefore, the better reporting| and organization of RCTs and CCTs should become a main goal of all stakeholders interested in the effective and| safe healthcare in the country.|\n",
